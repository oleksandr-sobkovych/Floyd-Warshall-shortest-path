# DiscreteProject
Discrete math project (task *20):
Find shortest path weight between every two nodes in a weighted graph using Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

Note: this project supports both directed and undirected graphs
(has graph type auto-detection).

# How to use our project?

## Download the project
```python 
$ git clone https://github.com/Alex-quickcoder/DiscreteProject.git
```
## Then, move to the project directory
```python
$ cd DiscreteProject
```

## Install all the libraries
```python
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the program
```python
$ python floyd.py
```

# Modules

* abstractcollection.py - abstract class for representing any collection

* graph.py - ADTs for representing directed and undirected graphs

* floyd.py - main program. Input graphs and run Floyd-Warshall algorithms on them
